pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly
Dataset and Data Files
Large Dataset Notice
The raw NYC taxi trip data files and the SQLite database are not included in this repository due to their large size (exceeding GitHub limits).

Downloading Data
You can download the raw trip data from the official NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission website:

NYC TLC Trip Record Data

The project expects the following files:

File	Description	Expected Path in Project
yellow-tripdata-YYYY-MM.csv	Raw taxi trip CSV data	data/raw/yellow-tripdata-YYYY-MM.csv
taxi_zone_lookup.csv	Lookup table for taxi zones	data/lookup/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
nyc_mobility.db	SQLite database with preprocessed data	db/nyc_mobility.db

Preparing Data
Place the downloaded CSV files under data/raw/.

Ensure the lookup CSV file (taxi_zone_lookup.csv) is present in data/lookup/.

You may use the included scripts in scripts/ folder to preprocess CSVs into the SQLite database if you want to rebuild it locally.

How to Run
From the project root directory, run the Streamlit app with:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run scripts/app.py
This will launch the interactive dashboard in your default web browser.

Notes on Large Files
GitHub limits file sizes to 100 MB. Therefore:

Large files like trip data CSVs and the SQLite database are excluded from the repo.

Consider using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) if you want to version large data files.

Alternatively, store large files on cloud storage and download them manually.
